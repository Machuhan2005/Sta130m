    "Communication skills play a crucial role as well. I need to be able to convey insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. Additionally, having domain knowledge in a specific industry can help me contextualize data and make more informed decisions.\n",

I explained that while it would be challenging, skills such as statistical knowledge, critical thinking, communication, domain knowledge, problem-solving, and project management are still valuable. I concluded that while coding and data analysis are important, developing complementary skills can lead to opportunities in data science-related roles.\n",

In this case, I think it is important for me to find my value in the market place so I will not completely lose job. I think it is a huge lesson for me to realized that nowsadays ai can code, so we human should not just learn how to memorize the facts and learn to code, and be like a machine.
